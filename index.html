                    <p class="bio">
                        With a passion for all things engineering, Alex enjoys finding that ideal solution that
                        considers
                        the whole. From studying the original system of the environment to the languages behind the
                        digital
                        world, Alex uses a variety of skills and experiences to engineer that solution. With an
                        entrepreneurial spirit, he looks to build upon these diverse skills and find areas that can
                        continue
                        to challenge him.

                    <p class="bio">
                        A Lancaster, PA, native, Alex went from saxophone player to rower at Lehigh University, when he
                        joined the class of 2013. When not rowing, Alex studied for a major in Environmental Engineering
                        and
                        also found a minor in science and environmental reporting. Staying at Lehigh for another two
                        years,
                        Alex continued studying environmental engineering to achieve a Master’s degree and researched
                        novel
                        waste to energy processes. This work led to a stint consulting with an energy startup and even
                        travelling to Turkey to set up a R&D lab there. Pivoting from the excitement of a startup, Alex
                        joined the Army Public Health Command in 2015. Serving as an Army civilian, Alex consulted and
                        led a
                        wide variety of environmental projects with a focus on field water and water reuse technologies.
                        In
                        December of 2018, Alex became a professional engineer in the state of Maryland.

                    <p class="bio">
                        Currently, Alex is expanding his knowledge in a newfound passion for coding. Still rowing, but
                        now
                        with Baltimore Community Rowing and the men’s competitive team, he aslso tried to find time to
                        hike,
                        ski, play games, or just relax by the river. His vice is older BMWs of which at any given time
                        may
                        or may not be running. Given the time, he will also make custom vinyl stickers as a creative
                        outlet.
                        Alex currently resides in Baltimore City with his fiance, Alyssa, and mini Irish-doodle, Moose.
