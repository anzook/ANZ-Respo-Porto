                <p class="bio">
                    With a passion for all things engineering, Alex enjoys finding that ideal solution that considers
                    the whole. From studying the original system of the environment to the languages behind the digital
                    world, Alex uses a variety of skills and experiences to engineer that solution. With an
                    entrepreneurial spirit, he looks to build upon these diverse skills and find areas that can continue
                    to challenge him.

                <p class="bio">
                    A Lancaster, PA, native, Alex went from saxophone player to rower at Lehigh University, when he
                    joined the class of 2013. When not rowing, Alex studied for a major in Environmental Engineering and
                    also found a minor in science and environmental reporting. Staying at Lehigh for another two years,
                    Alex continued studying environmental engineering to achieve a Master’s degree and researched novel
                    waste to energy processes. This work led to a stint consulting with an energy startup and even
                    travelling to Turkey to set up a R&D lab there. Pivoting from the excitement of a startup, Alex
                    joined the Army Public Health Command in 2015. Serving as an Army civilian, Alex consulted and led a
                    wide variety of environmental projects with a focus on field water and water reuse technologies. In
                    December of 2018, Alex became a professional engineer in the state of Maryland.

                    Currently, Alex is expanding his knowledge in a newfound passion for coding. Still rowing, but now
                    with Baltimore Community Rowing and the men’s competitive team, he aslso tried to find time to hike,
                    ski, play games, or just relax by the river. His vice is older BMWs of which at any given time may
                    or may not be running. Given the time, he will also make custom vinyl stickers as a creative outlet.
                    Alex currently resides in Baltimore City with his fiance, Alyssa, and mini Irish-doodle, Moose.
